# Project Overview

This repository serves as a digital archive of the legal documents for the Franklin Square Homeowners Association, Inc., located in Palm Harbor, Florida.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to provide Franklin Square homeowners with accessible, searchable copies of the community's governing legal documents. By maintaining these documents in a version-controlled, text-based format, residents can:

- Easily reference HOA rules, regulations, and bylaws
- Understand their rights and responsibilities as homeowners
- Review the historical evolution of community governance through amendments
- Access documents without needing to request physical or PDF copies from the Board of Directors

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **articles-of-incorporation.md** - The founding document establishing the Franklin Square Homeowners Association as a legal entity
- **declaration.md** - The Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) governing the community
- **bylaws.md** - The operational rules and procedures for the HOA Board of Directors and membership
- **amendments/** - A directory containing chronologically dated amendments to the governing documents (1986-2022)
- **rules-and-regulations/** - Specific rules including pool rules and architectural control standards

## Important Considerations

### Document Fidelity

The language in all markdown files is preserved exactly as it appears in the original legal documents. This includes:

- Original capitalization and punctuation
- Grammatical structures and phrasing
- Apparent typos or inconsistencies from the source documents

This preservation is critical because these are legal documents, and even minor variations in language could affect interpretation or enforceability.

### Formatting Decisions

While the textual content remains unchanged, some formatting decisions have been made to adapt the documents to markdown format, including:

- Header division placement for improved document structure
- Formatting choices to enhance scannability and navigation
- Adaptations to work within the constraints of markdown syntax

### Legal Disclaimer

This repository provides copies for reference purposes only. Anyone using these documents for legal purposes should:

- Consult the official recorded copies with the county or HOA management
- Verify the language against authoritative sources
- Seek appropriate legal counsel when needed

## Maintenance

The repository is maintained to keep the community's legal documents accessible and up-to-date. As new amendments or rules are adopted, they should be added to preserve the historical record and current state of governance.
