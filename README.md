## NOTES

This content was copied over by Chris Lagasse.

I make no claims to the full accuracy of the document copy provided within. I did my best to copy over the information, and kept capitalization and specific wording as-is. Typos or other potential 'mistakes' have been left in to the best of my ability.

Liberties were made as to where to make header divisions and some other content formatting. This was done based on appearance of document structure, the restraints of markdown, and a desire for scannability.

I recommend consulting the official copies and verifying the language  of these documents before using them for any legal purpose.
